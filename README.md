# Git Graph Research

Code for a small research project focused on analyzing Git repositories as a kind of
social network. All code is in the `git_sn` repo and is tied to a CLI, so running
`python -m git_sn` should pop up the CLI. All requirements are specified in the pipfile,
and resolved to exact versions in `Pipfile.lock`
